        <a id="header-files" />
        <h2 class="section-header">Header Files</h2>
        <p>
            In general, every <code>.cc</code> file should have an associated <code>.h</code> file. There are some
            common exceptions, such as unit tests and small <code>.cc</code> files containing just a <code>main()</code>
            function.
        </p>
        <p>
            Correct use of header files can make a huge difference to the readability, size and performance of one's
            code.
        </p>
        <p>
            The following rules will guide you through the various pitfalls of using header files.
        </p>

        <a id="header-files-self-contained-headers" />
        <h3 class="section-header">Self-contained Headers</h3>
        <p>
            Header files should be self-contained (compile on their own) and end in <code>.h</code>. Non-header files
            that are meant for inclusion should end in <code>.inc</code> and be used sparingly.
            <br>
            All header files should be self-contained. Users and refactoring tools should not have to adhere to special
            conditions to include the header. Specifically, a header should have <a
                href="#header-files-the-define-guard">header guards</a> and include all other headers it needs.
        </p>
        <p>
            When a header declares <code>inline</code> functions or templates that clients of the header will
            instantiate, the <code>inline</code> functions and templates must also have definitions in the header,
            either directly or in files it includes. Do not move these definitions to separately included header
            (<code>-inl.h</code>) files; this practice was common in the past, but is no longer allowed. When all
            instantiations of a template occur in one <code>.cc</code> file, either because they are <a
                href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/class_template#Explicit_instantiation">explicit</a> or
            because the definition is accessible to only the <code>.cc</code> file, the template definition can be kept
            in that file.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are rare cases where a file designed to be included is not self-contained. These are typically
            intended to be included at unusual locations, such as the middle of another file. They might not use <a
                href="#header-files-the-define-guard">header guards</a>, and might not include their prerequisites. Name
            such files with in <code>.inc</code> extension. Use sparingly, and prefer self-contained headers when
            possible.
        </p>

        <a id="header-files-the-define-guard" />
        <h3 class="section-header">The <code>#define</code> Guard</h3>
        <p>
            All header files should have <code>#define</code> guards to prevent multiple inclusion. The format of the
            symbol should be <code>&lt;PROJECT&gt;_&lt;PATH&gt;_&lt;FILE&gt;_H_</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
            To guarantee uniqueness, they should be based on the full path in a project's include tree. For example, the
            file <code>foo/include/foo/bar/baz_baz.h</code> in project <code>foo</code> should have the following guard:
        <pre>
                <code>
                    #ifndef FOO_BAR_BAZBAZ_H_
                    #define FOO_BAR_BAZBAZ_H_
                    ...
                    #endif // FOO_BAR_BAZBAZ_H_
                </code>
            </pre>
        </p>

        <a id="header-files-include-what-you-use" />
        <h3 class="section-header">Include What You Use</h3>
        <p>
            If a source or header file refers to a symbol defined elsewhere, the file should directly include a header
            file which properly intends to provide a declaration of definition of that symbol. It should not include
            header files for any other reason.
        </p>
        <p>
            Do not rely on transitive inclusions. This allows people to remove no-longer-needed <code>#include</code>
            statements from their headers without breaking clients. This also applies to related headers -
            <code>foo.cc</code> should include <code>bar.h</code> if it uses a symbol from it even if <code>foo.h</code>
            includes <code>bar.h</code>.
        </p>

        <a id="header-files-forward-declarations" />
        <h3 class="section-header">Forward Declarations</h3>
        <p>
            Avoid using forward declarations where possible. Instead, include the headers you need.
        </p>

        <h4>Definition:</h4>
        <p>
            A <q>forward declaration</q> is a declaration of an entity without an associated definition.
        <pre>
                    <code>
                        // In a C++ source file:
                        class B;
                        void FuncInB();
                        extern int variable_in_b;
                        ABSL_DECLARE_FLAG(flag_in_b);
                    </code>
                </pre>
        </p>

        <h4>Pros:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li />Forward declarations can save compile time, as <code>#include</code>s force the compiler to open more
            files
            and process more input.
            <li />Forward declarations can save on unnecessary recompilation. <code>#include</code>s can force your code
            to be
            recompiled more often, due to unrelated changes in the header.
        </ul>
        <br>

        <h4>Cons:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li />Forward declarations can hide a dependency, allowing user code to skip necessary recompilation when
            headers
            change.
            <li />A forward declaration as opposed to an <code>#include</code> statement makes it difficult for
            automatic
            tooling to discover the module defining the symbol.
            <li />A forward declaration may be broken by subsequent changes to the library. Forward declarations of
            functions
            and templates can prevent the header owners from making otherwise-compatible changes to their APIs, such as
            widening
            a parameter type, adding a template parameter with a default value, or migrating to a new namespace.
            <li />Forward declaring symbols from namespace <code>std::</code> yields undefined behavior.
            <li>
                It can be difficult to determine whether a forward declaration or a full <code>#include</code> is
                needed.
                Replacing an <code>#include</code> with a forward declaration can silently change the meaning of code:

                <pre>
                    <code>
                        // b.h
                        struct B {};
                        struct D : B {};

                        // good_user.cc:
                        #include "b.h"
                        void f(B*);
                        void f(void*):
                        void test(D *x) { f(x); } // Calls f(B*)
                    </code>
                </pre>

                If the <code>#include</code> was replaced with forward declarations for <code>B</code> and
                <code>D</code>, <code>test()</code> would call <code>f(void*)</code>.
            </li>
            <br>

            <li />Forward declaring multiple symbols from a header can be more verbose than simply
            <code>#include</code>ing the
            header.
            <li />Structuring code to enable forward declarations (e.g., using pointer members instead of object
            members) can make
            the code slower and more complex.
        </ul>

        <h4>Decision:</h4>
        <p>
            Try to avoid forward declarations of entities defined in another project.
        </p>

        <a id="header-files-inline-functions" />
        <h3 class="section-header">Inline Functions</h3>
        <p>
            Define functions <code>inline</code> only when they are small, say, 10 lines or fewer.
        </p>

        <h4>Definition:</h4>
        <p>
            You can declare functions in a way that allows the compiler to expand them inline rather than calling them
            through the usual function call mechanism.
        </p>

        <h4>Pros:</h4>
        <p>
            Inlining a function can generate more efficient object code, as long as the inlined function is small. Feel
            free
            to
            inline accessors and mutators, and other short, performance-critical functions.
        </p>

        <h4>Cons:</h4>
        <p>
            Overuse of inlining can actually make programs slower. Depending on a function's size, inlining it can cause
            the
            code
            size to increase or decrease. Inlining a very small accessor function will usually decrease code size while
            inling a
            very large function can dramatically increase code size. On modern processors smaller code usually runs
            faster
            due to
            better use of the instruction cache.
        </p>

        <b>Decision:</b>
        <p>
            A decent rule of thumb is to not inline a function if it is more than 10 lines long. Beware of destructors,
            which are
            often longer than they appear because of implicit member- and base-destructor calls!
        </p>
        <p>
            Another useful rule of thumb: it's typically not cost effective to inline functions with loops or switch
            statements
            (unless, in the common sense, the loop or switch statement is never executed).
        </p>
        <p>
            It is important to know that functions are not always inlined even if they are declared as such; for
            example,
            virtual and recursive functions are not normally inlined. Usually recursive functions should not be inline.
            The main
            reason for making a virtual function inline is to place its definition in the class, either for convenience
            or to
            document its behavior, e.g., for accessors and mutators.
        </p>

        <a id="header-files-names-and-order-of-includes" />
        <h3 class="section-header">Names and Order of Includes</h3>
        <p>
            Include headers in the following order: Related header, C system headers, C++ standard library headers,
            other libraries' headers, your project's headers.
        </p>
        <p>
            All of a project's header files should be listed as descendants of the project's source directory without
            use of UNIX directory aliases <code>.</code> (the current directory) or <code>..</code> (the parent
            directory). For example, <code>awesome-project/include/awesome-project/base/logging.h</code> should be
            included as:
        <pre>
                <code>
                    #include "awesome-project/base/logging.h"
                </code>
            </pre>
        </p>

        <p>
            In <code>dir/foo.cc</code> or <code>dir/foo_test.cc</code>, whose main purpose is to implement or test the
            stuff in <code>dir2/foo2.h</code>, order your includes as follows:
            <nl>
                <li /><code>dir2/foo2.h</code>.
                <li />A blank line.
                <li />C system headers (more precisely: headers in angle brackets with the <code>.h</code> extension),
                e.g., <code>&lt;unistd.h&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;stdlib.h&gt;</code>
                <li />A blank line.
                <li />C++ standard library headers (without file extension), e.g., <code>&lt;algorithm&gt;</code>,
                <code>&lt;cstddef&gt;</code>.
                <li />A blank line.
                <li />Other libraries' <code>.h</code> files.
                <li />A blank line.
                <li>Your project's <code>.h</code> files.</li>
            </nl>
            <br>
            Separate each non-empty group with one blank line.
        </p>
        <p>

            With the preferred ordering, if the related header <code>dir2/foo2.h</code> omits any necessary includes,
            the
            build of <code>dir/foo.cc</code> or <code>dir/foo_test.cc</code> will break. Thus, this rule ensures that
            build breaks show up first for the people working on these files, not for innocent people in other packages.
        </p>
        <p>

            <code>dir/foo.cc</code> and <code>dir2/foo2.h</code> are usually in the same directory (e.g.,
            <code>base/basictypes_test.cc</code> and <code>base/basictypes.h</code>), but may sometimes be in different
            directories too.
        </p>
        <p>
            Note that the C headers such as <code>stddef.h</code> are essentially interchangeable with their C++
            counterparts (<code>cstddef</code>). Either style is acceptable, but prefer consistency with existing code.
            If it's a newly created project, prefer to use their C++ counterparts (<code>cstddef</code>).
        </p>
        <p>
            Within each section the includes should be ordered alphabetically. Note that older code might not conform to
            this rule and should be fixed when convenient.
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, the includes in <code>awesome-project/src/awesome-project/foo/fooserver.cc</code> might
            look like this:
            <pre>
                <code>
                    #include "awesome-project/internal/foo/fooserver.h"

                    #include <sys/types.h>
                    #include <unistd.h>

                    #include <string>
                    #include <vector>

                    #include "base/basictypes.h"
                    #include "awesome-project/internal/foo/bar.h"
                    #include "third_party/absl/flags/flag.h"
                </code>
            </pre>
        </p>

        <h4>Exception</h4>
        <p>
            Sometimes, system-specific code needs conditional includes. Such code can put conditional includes after
            other includes. Of course, keep one's system-specific code small and localized. Example:
            <pre>
                <code>
                    #include "foo/public/fooserver.h"

                    #include "base/port.h" // For LANG_CXX11.

                    #ifdef LANG_CXX11
                    #include <initializer_list>
                    #endif // LANG_CXX11
                </code>
            </pre>
        </p>

        <h3 class="section-header">Namespaces</h3>
        <p>
            With few exceptions, place code in a namespace. Namespaces should have unique names based on the project
            name, and possibly its path. Do not use <code>using-directives</code> (e.g., <code>using namespace
            foo</code>). Do not use inline namespaces. For unnamed namespaces, see <a
            href="#scoping-internal-linkage">Internal Linkage</a>.
        </p>

        <h4>Definition</h4>
        <p>
            Namespaces subdivide the global scope into distinct, named scopes, and so are useful for preventing name collisions in the global scope.
        </p>

        <h4>Pros:</h4>
        <p>
            Namespaces provide a method for preventing name conflicts in large programs while allowing most code to use reasonably short names.
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, if two different projects have a class <code>Foo</code> in the global scope, these symbols may collide at compile time or at runtime. If each project places their code in a namespace, <code>project1::Foo</code> and <code>project2::Foo</code> are now distinct symbols that do not collide, and code within each project's namespace can continue to refer to <code>Foo</code> without the prefix.
        </p>
        <p>
            Inline namespaces automatically place their names in the enclosing scope. Consider the following snippet, for example:
            <pre>
                <code>
                    namespace outer
                    {
                        inline namespace inner
                        {
                            void foo();
                        } // namespace inner
                    } // namespace outer
                </code>
            </pre>
        </p>
        <p>
            The expressions <code>outer::inner::foo()</code> and <code>outer::foo()</code> are interchangeable. Inline namespaces are primarily intended for ABI compatibility across versions.
        </p>

        <h4>Cons:</h4>
        <p>
            Namespaces can be confusing, because they complicate the mechanics of figuring out what definition a name refers to.
        </p>
        <p>
            Inline namespaces, in particular, can be confusing becuase names aren't actually restricted to the namespace where they are declared. They are only useful as part of some larger versioning policy.
        </p>
        <p>
            In some contexts, it's necessary to repeatedly refer to symbols by their fully-qualified names. For deeply-nested namespaces, this can add a lot of clutter.
        </p>

        <h4>Decision:</h4>
        <p>
            Namespaces should be used as follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Follow the rules on <a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Namespace_Names">Namespace Names</a>.</li>
            <li>Terminate multi-line namespaces with comments as shown in the given examples.</li>
            <li>Insert an empty line after and before the curly brackets of the namespace scope.</li>
            <li>
                Namespaces wrap the entire source file after includes and forward declarations of classes from other namespaces.
                <pre>
                    <code>
                        // In the .h file

        <h3 class="section-header">Internal Linkage</h3>
        <p>
            When definitions in a <code>.cc</code> file do not need to be referenced outside that file, give them internal linkage by placing them in an unnamed namespace or declaring them <code>static</code>. Do not use either of these constructs in <code>.h</code> files.
        </p>

        <h4>Definition:</h4>
        <p>
            All declarations can be given internal linkage by placing them in unnamed namespaces. Functions and variables can also be given internal linkage by declaring them <code>static</code>. This means that anything one is declaring can't be accessed from another file. If a different file declares something with the same name, then the two entities are completely independent.
        </p>

        <h4>Decision:</h4>
        <p>
            Use of internal linkage in <code>.cc</code> files in encouraged for all code that does not need to be referenced elsewhere. Do not use internal linkage in <code>.h</code> files.
        </p>
        <p>
            Format unnamed namespaces like named namespaces. In the terminating comment, leave the namespace name empty:

        <a id="scoping-nonmember-static-member-and-global-functions" />
        <h3 class="section-header">Nonmember, Static Member, and Global Functions</h3>
        <p>
            Prefer placing nonmember functions in a namespace; use completely global functions rarely. Do not use a class simply to group static members. Static methods of a class should generally be closely related to instances of the class or the class's static data.
        </p>

        <h4>Pros:</h4>
        <p>
            Nonmember and static member functions can be useful in some situations. Putting nonmember functions in a namespace avoids polluting the global namespace.
        </p>

        <h4>Cons:</h4>
        <p>
            Nonmember and static member functions may make more sense as members of a new class, especially if they access external resources or have significant dependencies.
        </p>

        <h4>Decision:</h4>
        <p>
            Sometimes it is useful to define a function not bound to a class instance. Such a function can be either a static member or a nonmember function. Nonmember functions should not depend on external variables, and should nearly always exist in a namespace. Do not create classes only to group static members; this is no different than just giving the names a common prefix, and such grouping is usually unnecessary anyway.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you define a nonmember function and it is only needed in its <code>.cc</code> file, use <a href="#scoping-internal-linkage">Interal Linkage</a> to limit its scope.
        </p>

        <a id="scoping-local-variables" />
        <h3 class="section-header">Local Variables</h3>
        <p>
            Place a function's variables in the narrowest scope possible, and initialize variables in the declaration.
        </p>
        <p>
            C++ allows one to declare variables anywhere in a function. We encourage one to declare them in a scope as local as possible, and as close to the first use as possible. This makes it easier for the reader to find the declaration and see what type the variable is and what it was initialized to. In particular, initialization should be used instead of declaration and assignment, e.g.,:
            <pre>
                <code style="background-color: red;">
                    int i;
                    i = f(); // Bad -- initialization separate from declaration.
                </code>
            </pre>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    int i = f(); // Good -- declaration has initialization.
                </code>
            </pre>

            <pre>
                <code style="background-color: red;">
                    int jobs = NumJobs();
                    // More code...
                    f(jobs); // Bad -- declaration separate from use.
                </code>
            </pre>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    int jobs = NumJobs();
                    f(jobs); // Good -- declaration immediately (or closely) followed by use.
                </code>
            </pre>

            <pre>
                <code style="background-color: red;">
                    std::vector<int> v;
                    v.push_back(1); // Prefer initializing using brace initialization.
                    v.push_back(2);
                </code>
            </pre>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    std::vector<int> v = {1, 2}; // Good -- v starts initialized.
                </code>
            </pre>
        </p>
        <p>
            Variables needed for <code>if</code>, <code>while</code> and <code>for</code> statements should normally be declared within those statements, so that such variables are confined to those scopes. E.g.:
            <pre>
                <code>
                    while (const char* p = strchr(str, '/')) str = p + 1;
                </code>
            </pre>
        </p>
        <p>
            There is one caveat: if the variable is an object, its constructor is invoked every time it enters scope and is created, and its destructor is invoked every time it goes out of scope.
            <pre>
                <code style="background-color: red;">
                    // Inefficient implementation:
                    for (int i = 0; i < 1,000,000; ++i)
                    {
                        Foo f; // My ctor and dtor get called 1,000,000 times each.
                        f.DoSomething(i);
                    }
                </code>
            </pre>
        </p>
        <p>
            It may be more efficient to declare such a variable used in a loop outside that loop:
            <pre>
                <code>
                    Foo f; // My ctor and dtor get called once each.
                    for (int i = 0; i < 1,000,000; ++i)
                    {
                        f.DoSomething(i);
                    }

        <h3 class="section-header">Static and Global Variables</h3>
        <p>
            Objects with <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/storage_duration#Storage_duration">static storage duration</a> are forbidden unless they are <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/types/is_destructible">trivially destructible</a>. Informally this means that the destructor does not do anything, even taking member and base destructors into account. More formally it means that the type has no user-defined or virtual destructor and that all bases and non-static members are trivially destructible. Static function-local variables may use dynamic initialization. Use of dynamic initialization for static class member variables or variables at namespace scope is discouraged, but allowed in limited circumstances; see below for details.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a rule of thumb: a global variable satisfies these requirements if its declaration, considered in isolation, could be <code>constexpr</code>.
        </p>

        <h4>Definition:</h4>
        <p>
            Every object has a storage duration, which correlates with its lifetime. Objects with static storage duration live from the point of their initialization until the end of the program. Such objects appear as variables at namespace scope ("global variables"), as static data members of classes, or as function-local variables that are declared with the <code>static</code> specifier. Function-local static variables are initialized when control first passes through their declaration; all other objects with static storage duration are initialized as part of program start-up. All objects with static storage duration are destroyed at program exit (which happens before unjoined threads are terminated).
        </p>
        <p>
            Initialization may be <i>dynamic</i>, which means that something non-trivial happens during initialization. (For example, consider a constructor that allocates memory, or a variable that is initialized with the current process ID.) The other kind of initialization is <i>static</i> initialization. The two aren't quite opposite, though: static initialization <i>always</i> happens to objects with static storage duration (initializing the object either to a given constant or to a representation consisting of all bytes set to zero), whereas dynamic initialization happends after that, if required.
        </p>

        <h4>Pros:</h4>
        <p>
            Global and static variables are very useful for a large number of applications: named constants, auxiliary data structures internal to some translation unit, command-line flags, logging, registration mechanisms, background infrastructure, etc.
        </p>

        <h4>Cons:</h4>
        <p>
            Global and static variables that use dynamic initialization or have non-trivial destructors create complexity that can easily lead to hard-to-find bugs. Dynamic initialization is not ordered across translation units, and neither is destruction (except that destruction happens in reverse order of initialization). When one initialization refers to another variable with static storage duration, it is possible that this causes an object to be accessed before its lifetime has begun (or after its lifetime has ended). Moreover, when a program starts threads that are not joined at exit, those threads may attempt to access objects after their lifetime has ended if their destructor has already run.
        </p>

        <h4>Decision:</h4>

        <h5 class="section-header" style="color: blue;">Decision on destruction</h5>
        <p>
            When destructors are trivial, their execution is not subject to ordering at all (they are effectively not "run"); otherwise we are exposed to the risk of accessing objects after the end of their lifetime. Therefore, we only allow objects with static storage duration if they are trivially destructible. Fundamental types (like pointers and <code>int</code>) are trivially destructible, as are arrays of trivially destructible types. Note that variables marked with <code>constexpr</code> are trivially destructible.

            <code>
                const int kNum = 10; // Allowed

                struct X { int n; };
                const X kX[] = {{1}, {2}, {3}}; // Allowed

                void foo()
                {
                    static const char *const kMessages[] = {"hello", "world"}; // Allowed
                } // foo

                // Allowed: constexpr guarantees trivial destructor.
                constexpr std::array<int, 3> kArray = {1, 2, 3};
            </code>
        </pre>
        <pre>
            <code style="background-color: red;">
                // Bad: non-trivial destructor.
                const std::string kFoo = "foo";

                // Bad for the same reason, even though kBar is a reference
                // (the rule also applies to lifetime-extended temporary objects).
                const std::string &kBar = StrCat("a", "b", "c");

                void bar()
                {
                    // Bad: non-trivial destructor.
                    static std::map<int, int> kData = {{1, 0}, {2, 0}, {3, 0}};
                } // bar
            </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
            Note that references are not objects, and thus they are not subject to the constraints on destructibility. The constraint on dynamic initialization still applies, though. In particular, a function-local static reference of the form <code>static T &t = *new T;</code> is allowed.
        </p>

        <h5 class="section-header" style="color: red;">Decision on initialization</h5>
        <p>
            Initialization is a more complex topic. This is because we must not only consider whether class constructors execute, but we must also consider the evaluation of the initializer:
            <pre>
                <code>
                    int n = 5;      // Fine
                    int m = f();    // ? (Depends on f)
                    Foo x;          // ? (Depends on Foo::Foo)
                    Bar y = g();    // ? (Depends on g and on Bar::Bar)
                </code>
            </pre>
        </p>
        <p>
            All but the first statement expose us to indeterminate initialization ordering.
        </p>

        <p>
            The concept we are looking for is called <i>constant initialization</i> in the formal language of the C++ standard. It means that the initializing expression is a constant expression, and if the object is initialized by a constructor call, then the constructor must be specified as <code>constexpr</code>, too:
            <pre>
                <code>
                    struct Foo { constexpr Foo(int) {} };

                    int n = 5; // Fine, 5 is a constant expression.
                    Foo x(2);  // Fine, 2 is a constant expression and the chosen constructor is a constexpr.
                    Foo a[] = { Foo(1), Foo(2), Foo(3) }; // Fine
                </code>
            </pre>
        </p>

        <p>
            Constant initialization is always allowed. Constant initialization of static storage duration variables should be marked with <code>constexpr</code> or where possible the <a href="https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp/blob/03c1513538584f4a04d666be5eb469e3979febba/absl/base/attributes.h#L540">ABSL_CONST_INIT</a> attribute. Any non-local static storage duration variable that is not so marked should be presumed to have dynamic initializaition, and reviewed very carefully.
        </p>
        <p>
            By constrast, the following initializations are problematic:
            <pre>
                <code style="background-color: red;">
                    // Some declarations used below.
                    time_t time(time_t *);      // Not constexpr!
                    int f();                    // Not constexpr!
                    struct Bar { Bar() {} }; 

                    // Problematic initializations.
                    time_t m = time(nullptr);   // Initializing expression not a constant expression.
                    Foo y(f());                 // Ditto
                    Bar b;                      // Chosen constructor Bar::Bar() not constexpr.
                </code>
            </pre>
        </p>
        <p>
            Dynamic initialization of nonlocal variables is discouraged, and in general it is forbidden. However, we do permit it if no aspect of the program depends on the sequencing of this initialization with respect to all other initializations. Under those restrictions, the ordering of the initialization does not make an observable difference. For exmaple:
            <pre>
                <code>
                    int p = getpid();   // Allowed, as long as no other static variable
                                        // uses p in its own initialization.
                </code>
            </pre>
        </p>
        <p>
            Dynamic initialization of static local variables is allowed (and common).
        </p>

        <h5 class="section-header" style="color: blue;">Common patterns</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Global strings: if you require a named global or static string constant, consider using a <code>constexpr</code> variable of <code>string_view</code>, character array, or character pointer, pointing to a string literal. String literals have static storage duration already and are usually sufficient. See <a href="https://abseil.io/tips/140">TotW #140</a>.</li>
            <li>Maps, sets, and other dynamic containers: if you require a static, fixed collection, such as a set to search against or a lookup table, you cannot use the dynamic containers from the standard library as a static variable, since they have non-trivial destructors. Instead, consider a simple array of trivial types, e.g., an array of arrays ints (for a "map from int to int"), or an array of pairs (e.g., pairs of <code>int</code> and <code>const char *</code>). For small collections, linear search is entirely sufficient (and efficient, due to memory locality); consider using the facilities from <a href="https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp/blob/master/absl/algorithm/container.h">absl/algorithm/container.h</a> for the standard operations. If necessary, keep the collection in sorted order and use a binary search algorithm. If you do really prefer a dynamic container from the standard library, consider using a function-local static pointer, as described below.</li>
            <li>Smart pointers (<code>std::unique_ptr</code>, <code>std::shared_ptr</code>): smart pointers execute cleanup during destruction and are therefore forbidden. Consider whether you use cases fits into one of the other patterns described in this section. One simple solution is to use a plain pointer to a dynamically allocated object and never delete it (see last item).</li>
            <li>Static variables of custom types: if one require static, constant data of a type that one needs to define oneself, give the type a trivial destructor and a <code>constexpr</code> constructor.</li>
            <li>If all else fails, one can create an object dynamically and never delete it by using a function-local static pointer or reference (e.g., <code>static const auto &impl = *new T(args...);</code>).</li>
        </ul>
