        <a id="header-files" />
        <h2 class="section-header">Header Files</h2>
        <p>
            In general, every <code>.cc</code> file should have an associated <code>.h</code> file. There are some
            common exceptions, such as unit tests and small <code>.cc</code> files containing just a <code>main()</code>
            function.
        </p>
        <p>
            Correct use of header files can make a huge difference to the readability, size and performance of one's
            code.
        </p>
        <p>
            The following rules will guide you through the various pitfalls of using header files.
        </p>

        <a id="header-files-self-contained-headers" />
        <h3 class="section-header">Self-contained Headers</h3>
        <p>
            Header files should be self-contained (compile on their own) and end in <code>.h</code>. Non-header files
            that are meant for inclusion should end in <code>.inc</code> and be used sparingly.
            <br>
            All header files should be self-contained. Users and refactoring tools should not have to adhere to special
            conditions to include the header. Specifically, a header should have <a
                href="#header-files-the-define-guard">header guards</a> and include all other headers it needs.
        </p>
        <p>
            When a header declares <code>inline</code> functions or templates that clients of the header will
            instantiate, the <code>inline</code> functions and templates must also have definitions in the header,
            either directly or in files it includes. Do not move these definitions to separately included header
            (<code>-inl.h</code>) files; this practice was common in the past, but is no longer allowed. When all
            instantiations of a template occur in one <code>.cc</code> file, either because they are <a
                href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/class_template#Explicit_instantiation">explicit</a> or
            because the definition is accessible to only the <code>.cc</code> file, the template definition can be kept
            in that file.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are rare cases where a file designed to be included is not self-contained. These are typically
            intended to be included at unusual locations, such as the middle of another file. They might not use <a
                href="#header-files-the-define-guard">header guards</a>, and might not include their prerequisites. Name
            such files with in <code>.inc</code> extension. Use sparingly, and prefer self-contained headers when
            possible.
        </p>

        <a id="header-files-the-define-guard" />
        <h3 class="section-header">The <code>#define</code> Guard</h3>
        <p>
            All header files should have <code>#define</code> guards to prevent multiple inclusion. The format of the
            symbol should be <code>&lt;PROJECT&gt;_&lt;PATH&gt;_&lt;FILE&gt;_H_</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
            To guarantee uniqueness, they should be based on the full path in a project's include tree. For example, the
            file <code>foo/include/foo/bar/baz_baz.h</code> in project <code>foo</code> should have the following guard:
        <pre>
                <code>
                    #ifndef FOO_BAR_BAZBAZ_H_
                    #define FOO_BAR_BAZBAZ_H_
                    ...
                    #endif // FOO_BAR_BAZBAZ_H_
                </code>
            </pre>
        </p>

        <a id="header-files-include-what-you-use" />
        <h3 class="section-header">Include What You Use</h3>
        <p>
            If a source or header file refers to a symbol defined elsewhere, the file should directly include a header
            file which properly intends to provide a declaration of definition of that symbol. It should not include
            header files for any other reason.
        </p>
        <p>
            Do not rely on transitive inclusions. This allows people to remove no-longer-needed <code>#include</code>
            statements from their headers without breaking clients. This also applies to related headers -
            <code>foo.cc</code> should include <code>bar.h</code> if it uses a symbol from it even if <code>foo.h</code>
            includes <code>bar.h</code>.
        </p>

        <a id="header-files-forward-declarations" />
        <h3 class="section-header">Forward Declarations</h3>
        <p>
            Avoid using forward declarations where possible. Instead, include the headers you need.
        </p>

        <h4>Definition:</h4>
        <p>
            A <q>forward declaration</q> is a declaration of an entity without an associated definition.
        <pre>
                    <code>
                        // In a C++ source file:
                        class B;
                        void FuncInB();
                        extern int variable_in_b;
                        ABSL_DECLARE_FLAG(flag_in_b);
                    </code>
                </pre>
        </p>

        <h4>Pros:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li />Forward declarations can save compile time, as <code>#include</code>s force the compiler to open more
            files
            and process more input.
            <li />Forward declarations can save on unnecessary recompilation. <code>#include</code>s can force your code
            to be
            recompiled more often, due to unrelated changes in the header.
        </ul>
        <br>

        <h4>Cons:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li />Forward declarations can hide a dependency, allowing user code to skip necessary recompilation when
            headers
            change.
            <li />A forward declaration as opposed to an <code>#include</code> statement makes it difficult for
            automatic
            tooling to discover the module defining the symbol.
            <li />A forward declaration may be broken by subsequent changes to the library. Forward declarations of
            functions
            and templates can prevent the header owners from making otherwise-compatible changes to their APIs, such as
            widening
            a parameter type, adding a template parameter with a default value, or migrating to a new namespace.
            <li />Forward declaring symbols from namespace <code>std::</code> yields undefined behavior.
            <li>
                It can be difficult to determine whether a forward declaration or a full <code>#include</code> is
                needed.
                Replacing an <code>#include</code> with a forward declaration can silently change the meaning of code:

                <pre>
                    <code>
                        // b.h
                        struct B {};
                        struct D : B {};

                        // good_user.cc:
                        #include "b.h"
                        void f(B*);
                        void f(void*):
                        void test(D *x) { f(x); } // Calls f(B*)
                    </code>
                </pre>

                If the <code>#include</code> was replaced with forward declarations for <code>B</code> and
                <code>D</code>, <code>test()</code> would call <code>f(void*)</code>.
            </li>
            <br>

            <li />Forward declaring multiple symbols from a header can be more verbose than simply
            <code>#include</code>ing the
            header.
            <li />Structuring code to enable forward declarations (e.g., using pointer members instead of object
            members) can make
            the code slower and more complex.
        </ul>

        <h4>Decision:</h4>
        <p>
            Try to avoid forward declarations of entities defined in another project.
        </p>

        <a id="header-files-inline-functions" />
        <h3 class="section-header">Inline Functions</h3>
        <p>
            Define functions <code>inline</code> only when they are small, say, 10 lines or fewer.
        </p>

        <h4>Definition:</h4>
        <p>
            You can declare functions in a way that allows the compiler to expand them inline rather than calling them
            through the usual function call mechanism.
        </p>

        <h4>Pros:</h4>
        <p>
            Inlining a function can generate more efficient object code, as long as the inlined function is small. Feel
            free
            to
            inline accessors and mutators, and other short, performance-critical functions.
        </p>

        <h4>Cons:</h4>
        <p>
            Overuse of inlining can actually make programs slower. Depending on a function's size, inlining it can cause
            the
            code
            size to increase or decrease. Inlining a very small accessor function will usually decrease code size while
            inling a
            very large function can dramatically increase code size. On modern processors smaller code usually runs
            faster
            due to
            better use of the instruction cache.
        </p>

        <b>Decision:</b>
        <p>
            A decent rule of thumb is to not inline a function if it is more than 10 lines long. Beware of destructors,
            which are
            often longer than they appear because of implicit member- and base-destructor calls!
        </p>
        <p>
            Another useful rule of thumb: it's typically not cost effective to inline functions with loops or switch
            statements
            (unless, in the common sense, the loop or switch statement is never executed).
        </p>
        <p>
            It is important to know that functions are not always inlined even if they are declared as such; for
            example,
            virtual and recursive functions are not normally inlined. Usually recursive functions should not be inline.
            The main
            reason for making a virtual function inline is to place its definition in the class, either for convenience
            or to
            document its behavior, e.g., for accessors and mutators.
        </p>

        <a id="header-files-names-and-order-of-includes" />
        <h3 class="section-header">Names and Order of Includes</h3>
        <p>
            Include headers in the following order: Related header, C system headers, C++ standard library headers,
            other libraries' headers, your project's headers.
        </p>
        <p>
            All of a project's header files should be listed as descendants of the project's source directory without
            use of UNIX directory aliases <code>.</code> (the current directory) or <code>..</code> (the parent
            directory). For example, <code>awesome-project/include/awesome-project/base/logging.h</code> should be
            included as:
        <pre>
                <code>
                    #include "awesome-project/base/logging.h"
                </code>
            </pre>
        </p>

        <p>
            In <code>dir/foo.cc</code> or <code>dir/foo_test.cc</code>, whose main purpose is to implement or test the
            stuff in <code>dir2/foo2.h</code>, order your includes as follows:
            <nl>
                <li /><code>dir2/foo2.h</code>.
                <li />A blank line.
                <li />C system headers (more precisely: headers in angle brackets with the <code>.h</code> extension),
                e.g., <code>&lt;unistd.h&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;stdlib.h&gt;</code>
                <li />A blank line.
                <li />C++ standard library headers (without file extension), e.g., <code>&lt;algorithm&gt;</code>,
                <code>&lt;cstddef&gt;</code>.
                <li />A blank line.
                <li />Other libraries' <code>.h</code> files.
                <li />A blank line.
                <li>Your project's <code>.h</code> files.</li>
            </nl>
            <br>
            Separate each non-empty group with one blank line.
        </p>
        <p>

            With the preferred ordering, if the related header <code>dir2/foo2.h</code> omits any necessary includes,
            the
            build of <code>dir/foo.cc</code> or <code>dir/foo_test.cc</code> will break. Thus, this rule ensures that
            build breaks show up first for the people working on these files, not for innocent people in other packages.
        </p>
        <p>

            <code>dir/foo.cc</code> and <code>dir2/foo2.h</code> are usually in the same directory (e.g.,
            <code>base/basictypes_test.cc</code> and <code>base/basictypes.h</code>), but may sometimes be in different
            directories too.
        </p>
        <p>
            Note that the C headers such as <code>stddef.h</code> are essentially interchangeable with their C++
            counterparts (<code>cstddef</code>). Either style is acceptable, but prefer consistency with existing code.
            If it's a newly created project, prefer to use their C++ counterparts (<code>cstddef</code>).
        </p>
        <p>
            Within each section the includes should be ordered alphabetically. Note that older code might not conform to
            this rule and should be fixed when convenient.
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, the includes in <code>awesome-project/src/awesome-project/foo/fooserver.cc</code> might
            look like this:
            <pre>
                <code>
                    #include "awesome-project/internal/foo/fooserver.h"

                    #include <sys/types.h>
                    #include <unistd.h>

                    #include <string>
                    #include <vector>

                    #include "base/basictypes.h"
                    #include "awesome-project/internal/foo/bar.h"
                    #include "third_party/absl/flags/flag.h"
                </code>
            </pre>
        </p>

        <h4>Exception</h4>
        <p>
            Sometimes, system-specific code needs conditional includes. Such code can put conditional includes after
            other includes. Of course, keep one's system-specific code small and localized. Example:
            <pre>
                <code>
                    #include "foo/public/fooserver.h"

                    #include "base/port.h" // For LANG_CXX11.

                    #ifdef LANG_CXX11
                    #include <initializer_list>
                    #endif // LANG_CXX11
                </code>
            </pre>
        </p>

        <h3 class="section-header">Namespaces</h3>
        <p>
            With few exceptions, place code in a namespace. Namespaces should have unique names based on the project
            name, and possibly its path. Do not use <code>using-directives</code> (e.g., <code>using namespace
            foo</code>). Do not use inline namespaces. For unnamed namespaces, see <a
            href="#scoping-internal-linkage">Internal Linkage</a>.
        </p>

        <h4>Definition</h4>
        <p>
            Namespaces subdivide the global scope into distinct, named scopes, and so are useful for preventing name collisions in the global scope.
        </p>

        <h4>Pros:</h4>
        <p>
            Namespaces provide a method for preventing name conflicts in large programs while allowing most code to use reasonably short names.
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, if two different projects have a class <code>Foo</code> in the global scope, these symbols may collide at compile time or at runtime. If each project places their code in a namespace, <code>project1::Foo</code> and <code>project2::Foo</code> are now distinct symbols that do not collide, and code within each project's namespace can continue to refer to <code>Foo</code> without the prefix.
        </p>
        <p>
            Inline namespaces automatically place their names in the enclosing scope. Consider the following snippet, for example:
            <pre>
                <code>
                    namespace outer
                    {
                        inline namespace inner
                        {
                            void foo();
                        } // namespace inner
                    } // namespace outer
                </code>
            </pre>
        </p>
        <p>
            The expressions <code>outer::inner::foo()</code> and <code>outer::foo()</code> are interchangeable. Inline namespaces are primarily intended for ABI compatibility across versions.
        </p>

        <h4>Cons:</h4>
        <p>
            Namespaces can be confusing, because they complicate the mechanics of figuring out what definition a name refers to.
        </p>
        <p>
            Inline namespaces, in particular, can be confusing becuase names aren't actually restricted to the namespace where they are declared. They are only useful as part of some larger versioning policy.
        </p>
        <p>
            In some contexts, it's necessary to repeatedly refer to symbols by their fully-qualified names. For deeply-nested namespaces, this can add a lot of clutter.
        </p>

        <h4>Decision:</h4>
        <p>
            Namespaces should be used as follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Follow the rules on <a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Namespace_Names">Namespace Names</a>.</li>
            <li>Terminate multi-line namespaces with comments as shown in the given examples.</li>
            <li>Insert an empty line after and before the curly brackets of the namespace scope.</li>
            <li>
                Namespaces wrap the entire source file after includes and forward declarations of classes from other namespaces.
                <pre>
                    <code>
                        // In the .h file

        <h3 class="section-header">Internal Linkage</h3>
        <p>
            When definitions in a <code>.cc</code> file do not need to be referenced outside that file, give them internal linkage by placing them in an unnamed namespace or declaring them <code>static</code>. Do not use either of these constructs in <code>.h</code> files.
        </p>

        <h4>Definition:</h4>
        <p>
            All declarations can be given internal linkage by placing them in unnamed namespaces. Functions and variables can also be given internal linkage by declaring them <code>static</code>. This means that anything one is declaring can't be accessed from another file. If a different file declares something with the same name, then the two entities are completely independent.
        </p>

        <h4>Decision:</h4>
        <p>
            Use of internal linkage in <code>.cc</code> files in encouraged for all code that does not need to be referenced elsewhere. Do not use internal linkage in <code>.h</code> files.
        </p>
        <p>
            Format unnamed namespaces like named namespaces. In the terminating comment, leave the namespace name empty:

        <a id="scoping-nonmember-static-member-and-global-functions" />
        <h3 class="section-header">Nonmember, Static Member, and Global Functions</h3>
        <p>
            Prefer placing nonmember functions in a namespace; use completely global functions rarely. Do not use a class simply to group static members. Static methods of a class should generally be closely related to instances of the class or the class's static data.
        </p>

        <h4>Pros:</h4>
        <p>
            Nonmember and static member functions can be useful in some situations. Putting nonmember functions in a namespace avoids polluting the global namespace.
        </p>

        <h4>Cons:</h4>
        <p>
            Nonmember and static member functions may make more sense as members of a new class, especially if they access external resources or have significant dependencies.
        </p>

        <h4>Decision:</h4>
        <p>
            Sometimes it is useful to define a function not bound to a class instance. Such a function can be either a static member or a nonmember function. Nonmember functions should not depend on external variables, and should nearly always exist in a namespace. Do not create classes only to group static members; this is no different than just giving the names a common prefix, and such grouping is usually unnecessary anyway.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you define a nonmember function and it is only needed in its <code>.cc</code> file, use <a href="#scoping-internal-linkage">Interal Linkage</a> to limit its scope.
        </p>

        <a id="scoping-local-variables" />
        <h3 class="section-header">Local Variables</h3>
        <p>
            Place a function's variables in the narrowest scope possible, and initialize variables in the declaration.
        </p>
        <p>
            C++ allows one to declare variables anywhere in a function. We encourage one to declare them in a scope as local as possible, and as close to the first use as possible. This makes it easier for the reader to find the declaration and see what type the variable is and what it was initialized to. In particular, initialization should be used instead of declaration and assignment, e.g.,:
            <pre>
                <code style="background-color: red;">
                    int i;
                    i = f(); // Bad -- initialization separate from declaration.
                </code>
            </pre>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    int i = f(); // Good -- declaration has initialization.
                </code>
            </pre>

            <pre>
                <code style="background-color: red;">
                    int jobs = NumJobs();
                    // More code...
                    f(jobs); // Bad -- declaration separate from use.
                </code>
            </pre>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    int jobs = NumJobs();
                    f(jobs); // Good -- declaration immediately (or closely) followed by use.
                </code>
            </pre>

            <pre>
                <code style="background-color: red;">
                    std::vector<int> v;
                    v.push_back(1); // Prefer initializing using brace initialization.
                    v.push_back(2);
                </code>
            </pre>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    std::vector<int> v = {1, 2}; // Good -- v starts initialized.
                </code>
            </pre>
        </p>
        <p>
            Variables needed for <code>if</code>, <code>while</code> and <code>for</code> statements should normally be declared within those statements, so that such variables are confined to those scopes. E.g.:
            <pre>
                <code>
                    while (const char* p = strchr(str, '/')) str = p + 1;
                </code>
            </pre>
        </p>
        <p>
            There is one caveat: if the variable is an object, its constructor is invoked every time it enters scope and is created, and its destructor is invoked every time it goes out of scope.
            <pre>
                <code style="background-color: red;">
                    // Inefficient implementation:

        <h3 class="section-header">Static and Global Variables</h3>
        <p>
            Objects with <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/storage_duration#Storage_duration">static storage duration</a> are forbidden unless they are <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/types/is_destructible">trivially destructible</a>. Informally this means that the destructor does not do anything, even taking member and base destructors into account. More formally it means that the type has no user-defined or virtual destructor and that all bases and non-static members are trivially destructible. Static function-local variables may use dynamic initialization. Use of dynamic initialization for static class member variables or variables at namespace scope is discouraged, but allowed in limited circumstances; see below for details.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a rule of thumb: a global variable satisfies these requirements if its declaration, considered in isolation, could be <code>constexpr</code>.
        </p>

        <h4>Definition:</h4>
        <p>
            Every object has a storage duration, which correlates with its lifetime. Objects with static storage duration live from the point of their initialization until the end of the program. Such objects appear as variables at namespace scope ("global variables"), as static data members of classes, or as function-local variables that are declared with the <code>static</code> specifier. Function-local static variables are initialized when control first passes through their declaration; all other objects with static storage duration are initialized as part of program start-up. All objects with static storage duration are destroyed at program exit (which happens before unjoined threads are terminated).
        </p>
        <p>
            Initialization may be <i>dynamic</i>, which means that something non-trivial happens during initialization. (For example, consider a constructor that allocates memory, or a variable that is initialized with the current process ID.) The other kind of initialization is <i>static</i> initialization. The two aren't quite opposite, though: static initialization <i>always</i> happens to objects with static storage duration (initializing the object either to a given constant or to a representation consisting of all bytes set to zero), whereas dynamic initialization happends after that, if required.
        </p>

        <h4>Pros:</h4>
        <p>
            Global and static variables are very useful for a large number of applications: named constants, auxiliary data structures internal to some translation unit, command-line flags, logging, registration mechanisms, background infrastructure, etc.
        </p>

        <h4>Cons:</h4>
        <p>
            Global and static variables that use dynamic initialization or have non-trivial destructors create complexity that can easily lead to hard-to-find bugs. Dynamic initialization is not ordered across translation units, and neither is destruction (except that destruction happens in reverse order of initialization). When one initialization refers to another variable with static storage duration, it is possible that this causes an object to be accessed before its lifetime has begun (or after its lifetime has ended). Moreover, when a program starts threads that are not joined at exit, those threads may attempt to access objects after their lifetime has ended if their destructor has already run.
        </p>

        <h4>Decision:</h4>

        <h5 class="section-header" style="color: blue;">Decision on destruction</h5>
        <p>
            When destructors are trivial, their execution is not subject to ordering at all (they are effectively not "run"); otherwise we are exposed to the risk of accessing objects after the end of their lifetime. Therefore, we only allow objects with static storage duration if they are trivially destructible. Fundamental types (like pointers and <code>int</code>) are trivially destructible, as are arrays of trivially destructible types. Note that variables marked with <code>constexpr</code> are trivially destructible.
        </p>
        <pre>
            <code>
                const int kNum = 10; // Allowed

                struct X { int n; };

                } // foo

                // Allowed: constexpr guarantees trivial destructor.
                constexpr std::array<int, 3> kArray = {1, 2, 3};
            </code>
        </pre>
        <pre>
            <code style="background-color: red;">
                // Bad: non-trivial destructor.

                // Bad for the same reason, even though kBar is a reference
                // (the rule also applies to lifetime-extended temporary objects).
                const std::string &kBar = StrCat("a", "b", "c");

                void bar()
                {
                    // Bad: non-trivial destructor.
                    static std::map<int, int> kData = {{1, 0}, {2, 0}, {3, 0}};
                } // bar
            </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
            Note that references are not objects, and thus they are not subject to the constraints on destructibility. The constraint on dynamic initialization still applies, though. In particular, a function-local static reference of the form <code>static T &t = *new T;</code> is allowed.
        </p>

        <h5 class="section-header" style="color: blue;">Decision on initialization</h5>
        <p>
            Initialization is a more complex topic. This is because we must not only consider whether class constructors execute, but we must also consider the evaluation of the initializer:
            <pre>
                <code>
                    int n = 5;      // Fine
                    int m = f();    // ? (Depends on f)
                    Foo x;          // ? (Depends on Foo::Foo)
                    Bar y = g();    // ? (Depends on g and on Bar::Bar)
                </code>
            </pre>
        </p>
        <p>
            All but the first statement expose us to indeterminate initialization ordering.
        </p>

        <p>
            The concept we are looking for is called <i>constant initialization</i> in the formal language of the C++ standard. It means that the initializing expression is a constant expression, and if the object is initialized by a constructor call, then the constructor must be specified as <code>constexpr</code>, too:
            <pre>
                <code>
                    struct Foo { constexpr Foo(int) {} };

                    int n = 5; // Fine, 5 is a constant expression.
                    Foo x(2);  // Fine, 2 is a constant expression and the chosen constructor is a constexpr.
                    Foo a[] = { Foo(1), Foo(2), Foo(3) }; // Fine
                </code>
            </pre>
        </p>

        <p>
            Constant initialization is always allowed. Constant initialization of static storage duration variables should be marked with <code>constexpr</code> or where possible the <a href="https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp/blob/03c1513538584f4a04d666be5eb469e3979febba/absl/base/attributes.h#L540">ABSL_CONST_INIT</a> attribute. Any non-local static storage duration variable that is not so marked should be presumed to have dynamic initializaition, and reviewed very carefully.
        </p>
        <p>
            By constrast, the following initializations are problematic:
            <pre>
                <code style="background-color: red;">
                    // Some declarations used below.
                    time_t time(time_t *);      // Not constexpr!
                    int f();                    // Not constexpr!
                    struct Bar { Bar() {} }; 

                    // Problematic initializations.
                    time_t m = time(nullptr);   // Initializing expression not a constant expression.
                    Foo y(f());                 // Ditto
                    Bar b;                      // Chosen constructor Bar::Bar() not constexpr.
                </code>
            </pre>
        </p>
        <p>
            Dynamic initialization of nonlocal variables is discouraged, and in general it is forbidden. However, we do permit it if no aspect of the program depends on the sequencing of this initialization with respect to all other initializations. Under those restrictions, the ordering of the initialization does not make an observable difference. For exmaple:
            <pre>
                <code>
                    int p = getpid();   // Allowed, as long as no other static variable
                                        // uses p in its own initialization.
                </code>
            </pre>
        </p>
        <p>
            Dynamic initialization of static local variables is allowed (and common).
        </p>

        <h5 class="section-header" style="color: blue;">Common patterns</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Global strings: if you require a named global or static string constant, consider using a <code>constexpr</code> variable of <code>string_view</code>, character array, or character pointer, pointing to a string literal. String literals have static storage duration already and are usually sufficient. See <a href="https://abseil.io/tips/140">TotW #140</a>.</li>
            <li>Maps, sets, and other dynamic containers: if you require a static, fixed collection, such as a set to search against or a lookup table, you cannot use the dynamic containers from the standard library as a static variable, since they have non-trivial destructors. Instead, consider a simple array of trivial types, e.g., an array of arrays ints (for a "map from int to int"), or an array of pairs (e.g., pairs of <code>int</code> and <code>const char *</code>). For small collections, linear search is entirely sufficient (and efficient, due to memory locality); consider using the facilities from <a href="https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp/blob/master/absl/algorithm/container.h">absl/algorithm/container.h</a> for the standard operations. If necessary, keep the collection in sorted order and use a binary search algorithm. If you do really prefer a dynamic container from the standard library, consider using a function-local static pointer, as described below.</li>
            <li>Smart pointers (<code>std::unique_ptr</code>, <code>std::shared_ptr</code>): smart pointers execute cleanup during destruction and are therefore forbidden. Consider whether you use cases fits into one of the other patterns described in this section. One simple solution is to use a plain pointer to a dynamically allocated object and never delete it (see last item).</li>
            <li>Static variables of custom types: if one require static, constant data of a type that one needs to define oneself, give the type a trivial destructor and a <code>constexpr</code> constructor.</li>
            <li>If all else fails, one can create an object dynamically and never delete it by using a function-local static pointer or reference (e.g., <code>static const auto &impl = *new T(args...);</code>).</li>
        </ul>

        <a id="scoping-thread_local-variables" />
        <h3 class="section-header"><code>thread_local</code> Variables</h3>
        <p>
            <code>thread_local</code> variables that aren't declared inside a funciton must be initialized with a true compile-time constant, and this must be enforced by using the <a href="https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp/blob/master/absl/base/attributes.h">ABSL_CONST_INIT</a> attribute. Prefer <code>thread_local</code> over other ways of defining thread-local data.
        </p>

        <h4>Definition:</h4>
        <p>
            Variables can be declared with the <code>thread_local</code> specifier:
            <pre>
                <code>
                    thread_local Foo foo = ...;
                </code>
            </pre>
        </p>
        <p>
            Such a variable is actually a collection of objects, so that when different threads access it, they are actually accessing different objects. <code>thread_local</code> variables are much like <a href="#scoping-static-and-global-variables">static storage duration variables</a> in many respects. For instance, they can be declared at namespace scope, inside functions, or as static class members, but not as ordinary class members.
        </p>
        <p>
            <code>thread_local</code> variable instances are initialized much like static variables, except that they must be initialized separately for each thread, rather than once at program startup. This means that <code>thread_local</code> variables declared within a function are safe, but other <code>thread_local</code> variables are subject to the same initialization-order issues as static variables (and more besides).
        </p>
        <p>
            <code>thread_local</code> varaible instances are not destroyed before their thread terminates, so they do not have the destruction-order issues of static variables.
        </p>

        <h4>Pros:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Thread-local data is inherently safe from races (because only one thread can ordinarily access it), which makes <code>thread_local</code> useful for concurrent programming.</li>
            <li><code>thread_local</code> is the only standard-supported way of creating thread-local data.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Cons:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Accessing a <code>thread_local</code> variable may trigger execution of an unpredictable and uncontrollable amount of other code.</li>
            <li><code>thread_local</code> variables are effectively global variables, and have all the drawbacks of global variables other than lack of thread-safety.</li>
            <li>The memory consumed by a <code>thread_local</code> variable scales with the number of running threads (in the worst case), which can be quite large in a program.</li>
            <li>Non-static data members cannot be <code>thread_local</code>.</li>
            <li><code>thread_local</code> may not be as efficient as certain compiler intrinsics.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Decision:</h4>
        <p>
            <code>thread_local</code> variables inside a function have no safety concerns, so they can be used without restriction. Note that one can use a function-scope <code>thread_local</code> to simulate a class- or namespace-scope <code>thread_local</code> by defining a funciton or static method that exposes it:
            <pre>
                <code>
                    Foo &MyThreadLocalFoo()
                    {
                        thread_local Foo result = ComplicatedInitialization();
                        return result;
                    } // MyThreadLocalFoo
                </code>
            </pre>
        </p>
        <p>
            <code>Thread_local</code> variables at class or namespace scope must be initialized with a true compile-time constant (i.e., they must have no dynamic initialization). To enforce this, <code>thread_local</code> variables at class or namespace scope must be annotated with <a href="https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp/blob/master/absl/base/attributes.h"><code>ABSL_CONST_INIT</code></a> (or <code>constexpr</code>, but that should be rare):
            <pre>
                <code>
                    ABSL_CONST_INIT thread_local Foo foo = ...;
                </code>
            </pre>
        </p>
        <p>
            <code>thread_local</code> should be preferred over other mechanisms for defining thread-local data.

        <p>
            It's possible to use different ways to reference the same symbol, therefore we will define a standard way to reference those symbols in our projects.

        <ul>

                    <code>
                        // Notice the scope resolution operator at the very beginning of the C function call.

            <li>
                When one references symbols from inside a namespace, specify the relative scoping, e.g.:
                <pre>
                    <code>
                        namespace mynamespace

            <li>
                When one wants to reference symbols inside a namespace from another, including its outer namespace (if it's nested), specify the full scoping, same as what one is intended to do to reference a symbol from a C library. E.g.,:

                        } // namespace namespace2

            <li>
                When one wants to define a namespace alias, specify the full scoping, same as what one is intended to do to reference a symbol from a C library. E.g.,:
                <pre>
                    <code>
                        // In the global namespace
                        namespace mynamespace {}

                        // Notice the scope resolution operator at the beginning.
                        namespace my = ::mynamespace;
                    </code>
                </pre>
            </li>

        <h2 class="section-header">Classes</h2>
        <p>
            Classes are the fundamental unit of code in C++. Naturally, we use them extensively. This section lists the main dos and don'ts one should follow when writing a class.

        <h3 class="section-header">Doing Work in Constructors</h3>
        <p>
            Avoid virtual method calls in constructors, and avoid initialization that can fail if you can't signal an error.
        </p>

        <h4>Definition:</h4>
        <p>
            It is possible to perform arbitrary initialization in the body of the constructor.
        </p>

        <h4>Pros:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>No need to worry about whether the class has been initialized or not.</li>
            <li>Objects that are fully initialized by constructor call can be <code>const</code> and may also be easier to use with standard containers or algorithms.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Cons:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>If the work calls virtual functions, these calls will not get dispatched to the subclass implementations. Future modification to one's class can quietly introduce this problem even if one's class is not currently subclassed, causing much confusion.</li>
            <li>There is no easy way for constructors to signal errors, short of crashing the program (not always appropriate) or using exceptions.</li>
            <li>If the work fails, we now have an object whose initialization code failed, so it may be an unusual state requiring a <code>bool IsValid()</code> state checking mechanism (or similar) which is easy to forget to call.</li>
            <li>One cannot take the address of a constructor, so whatever work is done in the constructor cannot easily be handed off to, for example, another thread.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Decision:</h4>
        <p>
            Constructors should never call virtual funcitons. If appropriate for one's code, terminating the program may be an appropriate error handling response. Otherwise, consider a factory function or <code>Init()</code> method as described in <a href="https://abseil.io/tips/42">TotW #42</a>. Avoid <code>Init()</code> methods on objects with no other states that affect which public methods may be called (semi-constructed objects of this form are particularly hard to work with correctly).
        </p>

        <a id="classes-implicit-conversions" />
        <h3 class="section-header">Implicit Conversions</h3>
        <p>
            Do not define implicit conversions. Use the <code>explicit</code> keyword for conversion operators and single-argument constructors.
        </p>

        <h4>Definition:</h4>
        <p>
            Implicit conversions allow an object of one type (called the <i>source type</i>) to be used where a differnt type (called the <i>destination type</i>) is expected, such as when passing an <code>int</code> argument to a function that takes a <code>double</code> parameter.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to the implicit conversions defined by the language, users can define their own, by adding appropriate members to the class definition of the source or destination type. An implicit conversion is the source type is defined by a type conversion operator named after the destination type (e.g., <code>operator bool()</code>). An implicit conversion in the destination type is defined by a constructor that can take the source type as its only argument (or only argument with no default value).
        </p>
        <p>
            The <code>explicit</code> keyword can be applied to a constructor or a conversion operator, to ensure that it can only be used when the destination type is explicit at the point of use, e.g., with a cast. This applies not only to implicit conversions, but to list initialization syntax:
            <pre>
                <code>
                    class Foo
                    {
                    public:
                        explicit Foo(int x, double y);
                    }; // Foo

                    void Func(Foo f);
                </code>
            </pre>
            <pre>
                <code style="background-color: red;">
                    Func({42, 3.14});   // Error
                </code>
            </pre>
        </p>
        <p>
            This kind of code isn't technically an implicit conversion, but the language treats it as one as far as <code>explicit</code> is concerned.
        </p>

        <h4>Pros:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Implicit conversions can make a type more usable and expressive by eliminating the need to explicitly name a type when it's obvious.</li>
            <li>Implicit conversions can be a simpler alternative to overloading, such as when a single function with a <code>string_view</code> parameter takes the place of separate overloads for <code>std::string</code> and <code>const char *</code>.</li>
            <li>List initialization syntax is a concise and expressive way of initializing objects.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Cons:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Implicit conversions can hide type-mismatch bugs, where the destination type does not match the user's expectation, or the user is unaware that any conversion will take place.</li>
            <li>Implicit conversions can make code harder to read, particularly in the presence of overloading, by making it less obvious what code is actually getting called.</li>
            <li>Constructors that take a single argument may accidentally be usable as implicit type converions, even if they are not intended to do so.</li>
            <li>When a single-argument constructor is not marked <code>explicit</code>, there's no reliable way to tell whether it's intended to define an implicit conversion, or the author simply forgot to mark it.</li>
            <li>Implicit converions can lead to call-site ambiguities, especially when there are bidirectional implicit conversions. This can be caused either by having two types that both provide an implicit conversion, or by a single type that has both an implicit constructor and an implicit type conversion operator.</li>
            <li>List initialization can suffer from the same problems if the destination type is implicit, particularly if the list has only a single element.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Decision:</h4>
        <p>
            Type conversion operators, and constructors that are callable with a single argument, must be marked <code>explicit</code> in the class definition. As an exception, copy and move constructors should not be <code>explicit</code>, since they do not perform type conversion.
        </p>
        <p>
            Implicit conversions can sometimes be necessary and appropriate for types that are designed to be interchangeable, for example when objects of two types are just different representations of the same underlying value. In that case, contact one's project leads or club's architect or club's lead engineer to request a waiver of this rule.
        </p>
        <p>
            Constructors that cannot be called witha single argument may omit <code>explicit</code>. Constructors that take a single <code>std::initializer_list</code> parameter should also omit <code>explicit</code>, in order to support copy-initialization (e.g., <code>MyType m = {1, 2};</code>).
        </p>

        <a id="classes-copyable-and-movable-types" />
        <h3 class="section-header">Copyable and Movable Types</h3>
        <p>
            A class's public API must make clear whether the class is copyable, move-only, or neither copyable nor movable. Support copying and/or moving if these operations are clear and meaningful for one's type.
        </p>

        <h4>Definition:</h4>
        <p>
            A movable type is one that can be initialized and assigned from temporaries.
        </p>
        <p>
            A copyable type is one that can be initialized or assigned from any other object of the same type (so is also movable by definition), with the stipulation that the value of the source does not change. <code>std::unique_ptr&lt;int&gt;</code> is an example of a movable but not copyable type (since the value of the source <code>std::unique_ptr&lt;int&gt;</code> must be modified during assignment to the destination). <code>int</code> and <code>std::string</code> are examples of movable types that are also copyable. (For <code>int</code>, the move and copy operators are the same; for <code>std::string</code>, there exists a move operationthat is less expensive than a copy.)
        </p>
        <p>
            For user-defined types, the copy behavior is defined by the copy constructor and the copy-assignment operator. Move behavior is defined by the move constructor and the move-assignment operator, if they exist, or by the copy constructor and the copy-assignment operator otherwise.
        </p>
        <p>
            The copy/move constructors can be implicitly invoked by the compiler in some situations, e.g., when passing objects by value.
        </p>

        <h4>Pros:</h4>
        <p>
            Objects of copyable and movable types can be passed and returned by value, which makes APIs simpler, safer, and more general. Unlike when passing objects by pointer or reference, there's no risk of confusion over ownership, lifetime, mutability, and similar issues, and no need to specify them in the contract. It also prevents non-local interactions between the client and the implementation, which makes them easier to understand, maintain, and optimize by the compiler. Further, such objects can be used with generic APIs that require pass-by-value, such as most containers, and they allow for additional flexibility in e.g., type composition.
        </p>
        <p>
            Copy/move constructors and assignments operators are usually easier to define correctly than alternatives like <code>Clone()</code>, <code>CopyFrom()</code> or <code>Swap()</code>, because they can be generated by the compiler, either implicitly or with <code>= default</code>. They are concise, and ensure that all data members are copied. Copy and move constructors are also generally more efficient, because they don't require heap allocation or separate initialization and assignment steps, and they're eligible for optimizations such as <a href="">copy elision</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Move operations allow the implicit and efficient transfer of resources out of rvalue objects. This allows a plainer coding style in some cases.
        </p>

        <h4>Cons:</h4>
        <p>
            Some types do not need to be copyable, and providing copy operations for such types can be confusing, nonsensical, or outright incorrect. Types representing singleton objects (<code>Registerer</code>), objects tied to a specific scope (<code>Cleanup</code>), or closely coupled to object identity (<code>Mutex</code>) cannot be copied meaningfully. Copy operations for base class types that are to be used polymorphically are hazardous, because use of them can lead to <a href="">object slicing</a>. Defaulted or carelessly-implemented copy operations can be incorrect, and the resulting bugs can be confusing and difficult to diagnose.
        </p>
        <p>
            Copy constructors are invoked implicitly, which makes the invocation easy to miss. This may cause confusion for programmers used to languages where pass-by-reference in conventional or mandatory. It may also encourage excessive copying, which can cause performance problems.
        </p>

        <h4>Decision:</h4>
        <p>
            Every class's public interface must make clear which copy and move operations the class supports. This should usually take the form of explicitly declaring and/or delete the appropriate operations in the <code>public</code> section of the declaration.
        </p>
        <p>
            Specifically, a copyable class should explicitly declare the copy operations, a move-only class should explicitly declare the move operations, and a non-copyable/movable class should explicitly delete the copy operations. A copyable class may also declare move operations in order to support efficient moves. Explicitly declaring or deleting all four copy/move operations is permitted, but not required. If you provide a copy or move assignment operator, you must also provide the corresponding constructor.
            <pre>
                <code>
                    class Copyable
                    {
                    public:
                        Copyable(const Copyable &other) = default;
                        Copyable &operator=(const Copyable &other) = default;

                        // The implicit move operations are suppresed by the declarations above (the const qualifiers).
                        // You may explicitly declare move operations to support efficient moves. 
                    }; // class Copyable

                    class MoveOnly
                    {
                    public:
                        MoveOnly(MoveOnly &&other) = default;
                        MoveOnly &operator=(MoveOnly &&other) = default;

                        // The copy operations are implicitly deleted, 
                        // but one can spell that out explicitly 
                        // if one wants:
                        MoveOnly(MoveOnly &) = delete;
                        MoveOnly &operator=(MoveOnly &) = delete;
                    }; // class MoveOnly

                    class NotCopyableOrMovable
                    {
                    public:
                        // Not copyable or movable
                        NotCopyableOrMovable(const NotCopyableOrMovable &) = delete;
                        NotCopyableOrMovable &operator=(const NotCopyableOrMovable &) = delete;

                        // The move operations are implicitly disabled, 
                        // but one can spell that out explicitly
                        // if one wants:
                        NotCopyableOrMovable(NotCopyableOrMovable &&) = delete;
                        NotCopyableOrMovable &operator=(NotCopyableOrMovable &&) = delete;
                    }; // class NotCopyableOrMovable
                </code>
            </pre>
        </p>
        <p>
            These declarations/deletions can be omitted only if they are obvious:
            <ul>
                <li>If the class has no <code>private</code> section, like a <a href="#classes-structs-vs-classes">struct</a> or an interface-only base class, then the copyability/movability can be determined by the copyability/movability of any public data members.</li>
                <li>If a base class clearly isn't copyable or movable, derived classes naturally won't be either. An interface-only base class that leaves these operations implicit is not sufficient to make concrete subclasses clear.</li>
                <li>Note that if you explicitly declare or delete either the constructor or assignment operation for copy, the other copy operation is not obvious and must be declared and deleted. Likewise for move operations.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            A type should not be copyable/movable if the meaning of copying/moving is unclear to a casual user, or if it incurs unexpected costs. Move operations for copyable types are strictly a performance optimization and are a potential source of bugs and complexity, so avoid defining them unless they are significantly more efficient than the corresponding copy operations. If one's type provides copy operations, it is recommended that one designs one's class so that the default implementation of those operations is correct. Remember to review the correctness of any defaulted operations as you would any other code.
        </p>
        <p>
            To eliminate the risk of slicing, prefer to make base-classes abstract, by making their constructors protected, by declaring their destructors protected, or by giving them one or more pure virtual member functions. Prefer to avoid deriving from concrete classes.

            Use a <code>struct</code> only for passive objects that carry data; everything else is a <code>class</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <code>struct</code> and <code>class</code> keywords behave almost identically in C++. We add our own semantic meanings to each keyword, so one should use the appropriate keyword for the data-type one is defining.
        </p>
        <p>
            <code>struct</code>s should be used for passive objects that carry data, and may have associated constants. All fields must be public. The struct must not have invariants that imply relationships between different fields, since direct user access to those fields may break those invariants. Constructors, destructors, and helper methods may be present; however, these methods must not require or enforce any invariants.
        </p>
        <p>
            If more functionality or invariants are required, a <code>class</code> is more appropriate. If in doubt, make it a <code>class</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
            For consistency with <abbr title="Standard Template Library">STL</abbr>, one can use <code>struct</code> instead of <code>class</code> for stateless types, such as traits, <a href="">template metafunctions</a>, and some functors.
